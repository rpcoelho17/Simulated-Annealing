# Simulated-Annealing
Read Attached file "Post Grad Project V2 Final.pdf" for code description, tests, and explanation of the class properties. These files were developed as Final Project in Artificial Intelligence for pre-masters in Computer Science.

File "RodsAnnealMultiV2_2.py" contains the simulated annealing class.  File NeuralNetwMNSTV2_2.py is a test to use Simulated Annealing to optimize a neural network for digit recognition.
